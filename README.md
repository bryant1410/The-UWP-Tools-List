#  :ballot_box_with_check: The-UWP-Tools-List

UWP - Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10 Desktop, Windows 10 Tablets, Windows 10 Mobile Phones, Windows 10 Pixelsense, Windows 10 IOT, Windows Server, Windows 10 HoloLens, and Windows 10 Xbox.

Some UWP libraries are PCL based and should also work with Android and Apple IOS via Xamarin. PCL targeted at .NET 3 also work with Unity 3D as another way of targeting Android and IOS. This List is currently focused on Windows 10 devices but I'll try to call out other targets. The introduction of .NET Core should also help in this area.

On a Windows 10 Desktop or Tablet, a UWP App is typically deployed to a safe sandboxed environment via the Windows Store but the App can also be easily sideloaded to access legacy Windows 10 Desktop features and services with the [BCTemplates](https://github.com/lancecontreras/BCTemplates)  project being an example of one approach. This process has become very convenient with the Anniversary Update and is a simple setting in "Update & security" which makes a Windows 10 Tablet and Windows 10 Mobile device a very convenient deployment device for all kinds of touch based applications out in the "Real World"

This is extensive list (in progress) of potentially useful UWP Tools, Libraries, Samples etc to help make your UWP development more awesome. The list is non-curated (but with opininated comments when available). The ultimate objective is to provide a broad starting point for UWP development to perhaps help to offset the currently chaotic and sporadic information that is generally available.

All contributions are welcome. Try to include a Title, Link, Description but any comment is welcome. Adding an GitHub Issue is another low effort way to add something here. I'll even try to insert any editorial type comments you might want to share in order to make this document a bit more interesting to read over and above a rather dry list of projects.


# Microsoft


Note that current Microsoft Emulators are based on Hyper-V which is a low overhead VM technology. To painlessly fire up emulators, you need both a modern CPU that supports SLAT instructions and the "Pro" version of Windows 10.

### Microsoft Downloads and tools for Windows 10

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads

[Windows App Certification Kit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/develop/app-certification-kit) This is an often overlooked gem. If you have a .NET libary etc and want to know how much of you code depends on non UWP API, this tool can help.

[Windows 10 SDK] (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) This is required, but included with VS 2015.

[Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663275.aspx) DirectX is now a fundamental part of Windows.Starting with Windows 8, the DirectX SDK is included as part of the Windows SDK. We originally created the DirectX SDK as a high-performance platform for game development on top of Windows. As DirectX technologies matured, they became relevant to a broader range of applications. Today, the availability of Direct3D hardware in computers drives even traditional desktop applications to use graphics hardware acceleration. In parallel, DirectX technologies are more integrated with Windows. 

[Microsoft Lumia SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/featured/lumia) SensorCore SDK 1.2 Preview & Imaging SDK 3.0

### Code Samples

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/samples

[Microsoft UWP Official Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples) This is is the main repo of Microsoft UWP samples. A multitude of tiny code bits showing every part of UWP.

[Windows.UI.Composition](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs) With the deceptive name of "Windows UI dev labs" this repo contains code samples, demos, experiments, prototypes, and preview explorations that show how to use Windows.UI.Xaml and Windows.UI.Composition to make beautiful UWP applications. 

[Win2D](https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D/archive/master.zip) Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for immediate mode 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C# and C++ developers, and utilizes the power of Direct2D, integrating seamlessly with XAML and CoreWindow.

[Windows task snippets](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-task-snippets) Snippets of ready-to-use code that accomplish small, but useful, tasks of interest to UWP app developers. These snippets show simple solutions to common problems, and simple recipes to help you implement new app features.

[Photo Sharing App](https://github.com/Microsoft/Appsample-Photosharing) UWP app sample that demonstrates real-world social media experiences around photo sharing.

PhotoSharingApp is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that demonstrates real-world social media experiences around photo sharing.

With this app, users can earn virtual gold by uploading and sharing photos with people from all around the world. They can upload photos of their cats, shoes, houses, or last vacations, and see how they compete against other users. Are their photos a great gold source? Are they among the most generous contributors? They can find out on the app's leaderboard.

The goal of this app is to provide a complete, end-to-end example of a real-world app that uses a variety of UWP features, and exhibits design and development best practices. This makes it a great source of code you can copy into your own apps. It also provides an example of what a real-world app architecture might look like. The decoupled architecture makes it easy to reuse code or to make changes and build your own photo sharing app, which you can then publish in the Windows Store.

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Appsample-Photosharing/raw/master/Images/Category-Overview-Desktop-Mobile.jpg)

-    Browse photo categories and navigate into photo collections and photo details.
-    Take and upload photos directly in the app or upload an existing photo.
-    Give gold and add comments to photos uploaded by other users.
-    Receive push notifications when users are given gold for uploaded photos.
-    Explore a leaderboard of users with the most gold, users that have given the most gold to other photos, and the photos that have received the most gold.
-    Sign in with a Microsoft, Facebook, Google, or Twitter account.
-    Report content as abusive, inappropriate, or spam.
-    Buy virtual gold using in-app purchase.

- Adaptive UI using the SplitView control (see video on Channel 9) and adaptive triggers:
- In-app purchase (see the Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace):
- Separation between user interface, business logic and data models (MVVM):
- Extensibility and flexibility using the Unity dependency container:
- How to connect your app to an Azure App Service
- Real-world service implementation for storing uploaded photos using Azure DocumentDB
- Sign-in with Azure Mobile Apps:
- Usage analysis with Visual Studio Application Insights
- Push Notifications (see Integration with App Service Mobile Apps in Azure Notification Hubs:

[Rss Reader](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-rssreader) A UWP app sample for retrieving RSS feeds and viewing articles, demonstrating adaptive layout and hierarchical navigation patterns.

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-rssreader/blob/master/RssReader.png)

- The navigation menu (hamburger menu) pattern and screen-width adaptivity using the SplitView control and the AdaptiveTrigger class.
- The Syndication APIs (Windows.Web.Syndication) to retrieve RSS feed data.
- The DataContractSerializer class to save and restore app data from local storage.
- C# and XAML using the MVVM design pattern.

March 2016 update:

- A complete redesign of the UI to show effective use of color, type, images, and animated effects.
- Major improvements to layout, navigation, and window-size adaptivity to support small and large screens.
- Use of the WebView control to show articles within the app.
- The ability to rename feeds and to rearrange feeds and favorites.

We implemented the navigation and layout patterns in this sample using code from the XAML navigation menu and XAML master/detail samples in the Windows-universal-samples repo. These samples represent the current minimum recommendations for these patterns, and the RssReader sample will continue to reflect this guidance in future updates. 

[Family notes](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes)

FamilyNotes is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores different input modalities and scenarios of user awareness. The FamilyNotes sample is essentially a bulletin board app that allows family members to leave notes for each other on a common PC/tablet just like they would a bulletin board. Using text, speech, ink, or pictures, a user can create a note and tag it for another user. Later when that other user approaches the PC/Tablet, the app uses imaging APIs and the Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API) to detect their presence and display the notes that have been left for them, effectively filtering based on facial recognition. While the app is open, users can naturally interact with it using speech (“Add note for Bob”). If the app isn’t open, a user can easily launch it and interact with it using Cortana.

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes/raw/master/Screenshots/Using_Ink_Voice_and_Face_Recognition_in_a_UWP_App_Video.PNG)

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes/raw/master/Screenshots/FamilyNotes.PNG)

-    Speech recognition and speech synthesis by using the SpeechRecognizer and SpeechSynthesizer classes.
-    User detection using the MediaCapture and FaceDetectionEffect classes.
-    User facial recognition using the Microsoft Face API.
-    Activation through Cortana voice commands, defined in VoiceCommands.xml (a VCD file), using VoiceCommands and Activation classes.
-    Pen input using the InkCanvas API
-    JSON serialization using the DataContractJsonSerializer class.
-    Setting the app wallpaper using the Bing image of the day task snippet.

[Hue light controller](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller)

HueLightController is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores integrating Windows features with intelligent home automation. Specifically, it shows how you can use Cortana and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) to create an interactive experience with the Phillips Hue Lights (a Wi-Fi enabled lighting system). 

With Cortana integration, users are able to naturally interact with the lights through speech. They can turn the lights off, change their color, or even engage with Cortana in a back-and-forth conversation to adjust a specific light or change all the lights at once.

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller/raw/master/Screenshots/Connecting.png)

Additionally, through Bluetooth LE, the app supports a proximity scenario where the lights are automatically turned on/off depending on a user's device relative to a Bluetooth LE beacon. 

-    Using the HttpClient methods and Newtonsoft.json to interact with the Hue lights' RESTful interface.
-    Extending Cortana to provide an intuitive voice interface for manipulating the lights.
-    Using BLE APIs in the background to watch for a BLE beacon indicating proximity to the lights.
-    Showing an extended splash screen for more time while the app connects to the Hue hub and searches for lights.


[Traffic app](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp) and the [MVVM Version](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp/tree/MVVM)

Traffic App is a sample Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app for commuters to track drive times to various locations. The user adds frequently-visited destinations using app-bar buttons or by tapping and holding on the map. Traffic App then provides a quick view into how long it will take to drive to each place from the user’s current location, following the fastest route. The user can also flag a particular destination and a background task will periodically monitor traffic to that location, alerting the user when traffic is adding ten minutes or more to the travel time. 

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp/raw/MVVM/Images/TrafficApp.png)

-    MapControl and MapItemsControl (Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps)

-    Background tasks (Windows.ApplicationModel.Background)
-    Toast notifications (Windows.UI.Notifications)
-    Local storage and serialization (Windows.Storage)

[Network helper](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper) NetworkHelper library and Quiz Game

NetworkHelper is a sample library that demonstrates the use UWP networking APIs to enable network discovery and communication in your games or apps. Specifically, the library provides the ability for:

-    Wi-Fi network discovery and management peer clients over a local Wi-Fi network.
-    Direct communication between discovered devices on the same Wi-Fi network with developer configurable messages.

![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper/raw/master/Screenshots/QuizGame_JoinGame_scaled.png)
![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper/raw/master/Screenshots/QuizGame_GameInProgress_scaled.png)

QuizGame is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that uses the NetworkHelper library to enable a pub-style trivia game. When running the sample, you are presented with an option to create a new game as a quiz master on your local network or join an existing game and answer questions from the quiz master. Questions appear on the quiz master's screen while players answer the questions on their own devices. A quiz master can advance the game to additional questions and display the scores at the end. Below are some features that QuizGame uses.

-    Simple MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel) coding pattern
-    Simple navigation using code-behind files.
-    NetworkHelper to enable discovery and broadcasting of available games on the local network.
-    NetworkHelper to enable communication between the game and players.


[Marble Maze](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-appsample-marble-maze)

Marble Maze is a sample Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and DirectX app that demonstrates how to build a basic 3D game using DirectX. This game is a simple labyrinth game where the player is challenged to roll a marble through a maze of pitfalls using tilt controls.

This sample is written in C++ and requires some experience with graphics programming and DirectX. Complete content that examines this code can be found at Developing Marble Maze, a game in C++ and DirectX.

# Information
[awesome-uwp](https://github.com/tomzorz/awesome-uwp) Awesome UWP resources - inspired by Awesome .NET. - It appears to be a normal "awesome-style" "curated" list whereas [The-UWP-Tools-List](https://github.com/10UWP/The-UWP-Tools-List) is an attempt to include all possibly useful UWP tools and code. Over time, I hope to have just about everything I can find on GitHub and anywhere else so examine all code carefully before using (but the great glory of open source is that the code speaks for itself) and make sure it has a license you are happy with.  

# Tools

Note to add some actual Tools that might be handy for UWP development.

[IconCreatorForUWP](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton/IconCreatorForUWP) IconCreator helps you (developers) create icons of you UWP apps. Just simply import your .png icon file and click the start button. 

[AppxInstaller](https://github.com/aL3891/AppxInstaller) This repostitory was created in respose to some misconceptions and incorrect information about the universal windows platform (UWP) apps, specifically with regards to their dependency on the windows store and suppsed inability to be distributed outside it. This folder contains a powershell script, Generate-AppxMsi.ps1, that packages an appx file into an msi. It will also embed an installation script that will enable sideloading in the registry, trust the application cert if it is not already trusted and deploy the application. Currently this script is a proof of concept with hardcoded values, but later on it will be able to wrap any appx or appx bundle like this and read all the relevant information from the package directly. Appx installer is a file handler for appx files. Using it, when a appx file is double clicked, a window is shown with information about the app. The user can then click install to install the app.




# Database

[EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework) Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. The ONLY UWP option is SQLite and [it is a mess](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/providers/sqlite/limitations.html). [Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/platforms/uwp/getting-started.html) (Opinionated Note: "Microsoft's recommended data access technology" has somehow ended up in the damaged situation of SQLite being the ONLY supported target for Microsoft's main thing, the Universal Windows Platform. The insanely stupid SQLite FK mess means that Entity Framework's Magic Unicorn (Migrations) becomes a useless broken technology on the One Microsoft platform that should count as the highest priority effort. UWP without an easy robust Microsoft supported data platform is a Microsoft blind spot that has been a drag on the success of the Win RT platform from the beginning. "You can workaround some of these limitations by manually writing code in your migrations to perform a table rebuild. A table rebuild involves renaming the existing table, creating a new table, copying data to the new table, and dropping the old table. You will need to use the Sql(string) method to perform some of these steps." (https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/329) There is an explanation in this issue: [ESENT database provider](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/4423) which probably translates to "please hold" for another few months)  

### SQLite

[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. Microsoft uses SQLite as a core component of Windows 10, and in individual numerous products. [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET provider for SQLite.  Development and maintenance work is now mostly performed by the SQLite Development Team. The SQLite team is committed to supporting System.Data.SQLite long-term. [git mirror of SQLite](https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite) - [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) Official home of the DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) project. Previously known as "SQLite Database Browser" and "Database Browser for SQLite". Website at: http://sqlitebrowser.org

[Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) SQLite implementations of the System.Data.Common interfaces

[sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) sqlite-net is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in SQLite 3 databases. It is written in C# and is meant to be simply compiled in with your projects. It was first designed to work with MonoTouch on the iPhone, but has grown up to work on all the platforms (Mono for Android, .NET, Silverlight, WP7, WinRT, Azure, etc.). Very simple methods for executing CRUD operations and queries safely (using parameters) and for retrieving the results of those query in a strongly typed fashion. Works with your data model without forcing you to change your classes. (Contains a small reflection-driven ORM layer.)

[SQLitePCL.raw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw) SQLitePCL.raw is a Portable Class Library (PCL) for low-level (raw) access to SQLite. This library is designed to be the common portable layer upon which friendlier wrappers can be built. Right now, every C# SQLite library writes their own P/Invoke and COM and marshaling and stuff. Build on this library instead and focus more on the upper layer and its goal of providing a pleasant, easy-to-use API for app developers. When people ask me to recommend a friendlier SQLite wrapper, sqlite-net is the one that I usually recommend. SQLitePCL.pretty is another friendly SQLite API wrapper. 

[SQLitePCL.pretty](https://github.com/bordoley/SQLitePCL.pretty) This library wraps the C like SQLiteAPI provided by SQLitePCL.raw with a friendly C# object oriented API. It adds an Async API. SQLitePCL.pretty has a very simple table mapping ORM, available in the SQLitePCL.pretty.Orm package on nuget. It supports inserting both new and existing objects, and finding and deleting objects by primary key, from SQLite database tables. Notably, the ORM is designed to make working with immutable data types much easier by supporting the builder pattern for deserializing database objects. Ineresting features include the ability to iterate through query result sets using LINQ, support for binary streaming of data in and out of SQLite using .NET streams, and a powerful async API built on the RX framework."

### ESENT

[ESENT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/gg269181%28v=exchg.10%29.aspx) Extensible Storage Engine is built into and is available for use on every Windows computer and has been an approved DLL for Windows Store since Windows 8.0. Updates to the database are implemented with a transaction in order to ensure secure operations. ESE enables simultaneous access to multiple databases, including transaction-log file databases that can be used for system recovery. ESE is scalable to large or small applications. [ESENT Managed Interop](https://managedesent.codeplex.com/) it is not clear if the .NET wrapper is UWP compatible."It is clear. ESENT Managed Interop is compatible with UWP. Not all nuget package are, but core Interop package on nuget is compatible with UWP, I tested it myself and it work." Thanks to [Opiumtm](https://github.com/Opiumtm) for testing that.

### DBreeze

[DBreeze](https://github.com/hhblaze/DBreeze) - This has a native UWP DLL and is an *embeddable Database solution for UWP Apps* - http://dbreeze.codeplex.com/ - Professional, open-source, NoSql (embedded Key / Value storage), transactional, ACID-compliant, multi-threaded, object database management system for
.NET 3.5> / XAMARIN MONO / .NET Core / UWP (Universal Windows Platform). Written in C# .

### BrightStar

[BrightstarDB](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB) BrightstarDB is a native .NET RDF triple store. It uses dotNetRDF to provide support for a wide range of RDF syntaxes as well as SPARQL query support. In addition to providing a raw RDF-based API, BrightstarDB also provides support for binding RDF resources to .NET dynamic objects; and a contract-first entity framework that enables the use of LINQ rather than SPARQL for query purposes.

### Marcello

[MarcelloDB](https://github.com/markmeeus/MarcelloDB) .net/mono/xamarin/winrt in-process object database. MarcelloDB is a mobile NoSql database. It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint. MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and collections. Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code. MarcelloDB is a pure C# implementation, so there is no need to package other binaries.






### LiteDB

[LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB) - http://www.litedb.org/-LiteDB - A .NET NoSQL Document Store in a single data file. LiteDB is now functional for UWP via PCL.

### Couchbase

[Couchbase](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net) - http://www.couchbase.com/ - http://developer.couchbase.com/mobile/ - The NoSQL database solution for mobile — everything you need to build always-available apps that work online & offline. Couchbase Lite is
a fully functional, on-device, lightweight, native, embedded NoSQL database. With Couchbase Lite, you have the full power of a Couchbase database locally on the device. You can create, update, delete, query, sync and much, much more.

#### Note:
Based on this GitHub issue: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net/issues/535 - Couchbase Lite for .NET will be available soon for UWP. "my goal is to still have it in 2016. After the 1.3 release we are going to assess platform support going forward (including the possibility of dropping some, which would free up time for UWP)."

# Composition

Note: Composition is part of the Windows API since 10586 and it should just get used. It is part of the solution to the many WPF performance complaints from Vista days. Another large issue from those days was 3D interop with DirectX and here I am not seeing any projects exploring Windows.UI.Composition and DirectX. Anyone? There is this project: [DirectCompositionDirectX12Sample](https://github.com/PJayB/DirectCompositionDirectX12Sample)

If you are a developer getting familiar with the Windows.UI.Xaml and Windows.UI.Composition APIs, want to build beautiful UI experiences, and don't mind a few bugs here and there; then, this is the place for you. We also want to see what inspiring UX you're building and you can reach out to us on Twitter @WindowsUI. We're excited to see what you can you make with Windows UI.

We are pleased to announce that as of Windows 10 Build 10586 and SDK Version 1511 the Windows.UI.Composition API is now fully public. Many thanks to all of those who contibuted feedback to on the API during it's preview phase to make it that much better.

# Controls

[UWPCommunityToolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit) Updated to 1.1 :sun_with_face: Microsoft has assembled about 12 Controls, many of them from other projects on this list, and other misc helper libs for UWP programming. At the moment, it seems like it is far less ambitious in scope than their Template 10 project, yet for some reason they have heavily promoted this Community Toolkit both with press releases and featuring on their [Developer website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/samples). The [UWPCommunityToolkit-docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit-docs) is a separate GitHub project which feeds this [Microsoft.com Windows Dev site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp-community-toolkit). There is a [Sample App in Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) that allows you to see exactly what is in the kit. 

There is no mention of any Blend specific features or add-ons but there is an instruction on [how to add the kit to the VS 2015 Designer Toolbox](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp-community-toolkit/toolbox). Actually, Blend does a great job of picking up any controls referenced in the project and no installation is needed. Please keep Blend alive and get the add-ons working right for Blend!

For some reason Windows Composition is partially missing in action for this kit. IMO, both Windows Composition and Win2D are unique Microsoft UWP technologies that can make the platform exciting and are natural candidates for this Microsoft showcase. Part of the problem is that Anniversary (14393) is where Composition starts to light up and show its significance and the Community Toolkit wants to support the previous Windows 10 version as well.

[WinRTXamlToolkit](https://github.com/xyzzer/WinRTXamlToolkit) A set of controls, extensions and helper classes for Windows Runtime XAML applications.

#### Controls

-    AlternativeFrame, AlternativePage - support asynchronous page transitions and preloading pages so when navigation is initiated - all content might already be loaded. Includes 4 built-in transitions: dissolve, flip, push, wipe. You can add new ones yourself.
-    AnimatingContainer - a container control that will animate its contents rotating or zooming in/out, eg. to make them feel more alive.
-    AutoCompleteTextBox - a TextBox with dictionary-based autocompletion support by fex with keyboard support added by yours truly.
-    CameraCaptureControl - supports displaying camera preview, capturing photos and videos, cycling between existing video capture devices, setting preference to Front/Back panel camera, etc.
-    CascadingTextBlock - a TextBlock replacement that animates the individual letters in a cascade - fading in while falling down into position, then optionally fading out while falling down from the standard position.
-    Chart - Silverlight Toolkit's Chart control ported by Mahmoud Moussa (ZeeMoussa on CodePlex) and merged from his Windows 8 Toolkit - Charts and More project. Supports pie charts, bar charts, scatter charts, etc.
-    CountdownControl - a movie-style control that animates a ring-slice shape while counting down seconds - e.g. to take a picture with a camera after a given number of seconds (supports async/await).
-    CustomAppBar - a custom implementation of the AppBar that automatically handles the three gestures to switch IsOpen (WinKey+Z, Right-Click, EdgeGesture), adds a CanOpen property, so you can prevent it from opening and opens/hides with a sliding animation when placed anywhere in the app, so you can layer content on top of it. Also features CanDismiss property to force the app bar to stay open in some situations, CanOpenInSnappedView which allows to block the app bar from showing up when the app is in the snapped view.
-    CustomGridSplitter - a custom implementation of a GridSplitter as a templated control.
-    DelayedLoadControl - given a content/DataTemplate - loads the contents after a given amount of time - e.g. to allow for staged loading of contents on screen.
-    ImageButton - a custom Button control that takes one to three images to be used to represent different states of the button (normal/hover/pressed/disabled) as well as ways for the button to render all 4 states with just one or two images.
-    ImageToggleButton - custom ToggleButton control, that like ImageButton - helps create buttons based on button state images using from 1 to 8 different state images and generating other state images with some simple image processing.
-    InputDialog - a custom/templated dialog control that takes text input.
-    ListItemButton - a simple button control with Click event and Command property to be used inside of list controls (the standard button steals pointer capture from the List/Grid~Items so they can't be selected.
-    NumericUpDown - allows to display and manipulate a number using text input, +/- buttons or Blend-like swipe-manipulations
-    PieSlice - a pie slice path/shape given StartAngle, EndAngle and Radius.
-    RingSlice - a pie slice path/shape given StartAngle, EndAngle, Radius and InnerRadius.
-    TreeView - traditional tree view control ported from Silverlight Toolkit. Has separate touch and mouse themes.
-    ToolWindow - a window content control that snaps/docks to edges if the screen or parent control.
-    WatermarkTextBox - TextBox control with a watermark. Set WatermarkText to change the watermark prompt, change WatermarkStyle to change the style of the watermark TextBlock.
-    WebBrowser - a templated control with a WebView + address bar, title bar, backstack navigation, favicon. work in progress (visual states are a bit messed up), but might be helpful as a starting point
-    WrapPanel (ported from Silverlight Toolkit) - used for layout of child items in wrapping rows or columns - similar to the way text wraps on a page. Different than VariableSizedWrapGrid since it supports items of varying size and auto-sized rows or columns, but it is not a grid and so it does not explicitly support items spanning multiple cells without the use of negative margins.

#### Controls.Extensions

-    AnimationHelper - two attached properties - Storyboard and IsPlaying. Allows to easily control Storyboard playback from a view model (note limitation - a single storyboard per control).
-    AppBarExtensions.HideWhenSnapped - allows to make the AppBar automatically hide when the app goes to the snapped view.
-    ContentControlExtensions.FadeTransitioningContentTemplate - allows to change content template with a fade out/fade in transition.
-    ControlExtensions.Cursor - enables setting a mouse cursor to show when hovering over a control.
-    FrameworkElementExtensions.ClipToBounds - automatically updates the Clip property to clip the contents of the element to its bounds.
-    ImageExtensions.FadeInOnLoaded/.Source - allows to specify an image source such that the image fades in smoothly when the image source is loaded.
-    ListBoxExtensions./ListViewExtensions
-        BindableSelection - allows a two-way binding of the SelectedItems collection on the Selector/list controls.
-        ItemToBringIntoView - allows to control which item should be visible through a view model binding without changing the selected item itself.
-    ManipulationInertiaStartingRoutedEventArgsExtensions - adds extensions to the arguments of the ManipulationInertiaStarting event that calculate flick ballistics - help determine and control where and when an inertial manipulation will end so you can make your flicks always end where you want them to! It's the basis of the ToolWindow behavior where a flicked window always quickly and smoothly snaps to the side of the screen.
-    RichTextBlockExtensions
-        PlainText - attached property that allows to easily single-way-bind plain text to a RichTextBlock (not really that useful other than for visualizing RichTextBlock styles in the sample app provided).
-        LinkedHtmlFragment - attached property that allows to easily single-way-bind plain text with HTML links (anchor tags) to a RichTextBlock to automatically generate links. Extension methods like SetLinkedHtmlFragment() and AppendLink() are also available.
-    ScrollViewerExtensions.ScrollToHorizontalOffsetWithAnimation(), .ScrollToVerticalOffsetWithAnimation() - provide a way to scroll a ScrollViewer to specified offset with an animation.
-    TextBlockExtensions/GetCharacterRect() - an extension method that returns a rectangle that holds a character at a given index in the TextBlock.
-    TextBoxValidationExtensions - extensions that allow to specify the Format of the requested Text input as well as brushes to use to highlight a TextBox with valid or invalid Text.
-    ViewboxExtensions.GetChildScaleX()/GetChildScaleY() - return the effective scale of the Viewbox Child.
-    VisualTreeHelperExtensions - provides a set of extension methods that enumerate visual tree ascendants/descendants of a given control - making it easy to do these operations with LINQ as well as simple ways to list controls of a given type or find the first control of a given type searching up or down the visual tree.
-    WebViewExtensions - extensions to get currently loaded page address, title, favicon, head tag's inner HTML.
#### Imaging Extensions

-    BitmapImageLoadExtensions - extensions to simplify loading BitmapImages based on StorageFile or file name
-    ColorExtensions - Conversions between pixels and pixel buffer types of byte, int and Color
-    IBufferExtensions - Adds a GetPixels() extension method to the PixelBuffer property of a WriteableBitmap that reads in the buffer to a byte array and exposes an indexer compatible to the one of the Pixels property in Silverlight's WriteableBitmap
-    WriteableBitmap~ - a set of extension methods for a WriteableBitmap
-        WriteableBitmapSaveExtensions - support for loading and saving the bitmap to/from files
-        WriteableBitmapBlitBlockExtensions - support for quick blitting of a full-width section of a bitmap to another bitmap of same width
-        WriteableBitmapCopyExtensions - support creating a copy of a WriteableBitmap
-        WriteableBitmapCropExtensions - support for creating a cropped version of a WriteableBitmap
-        WriteableBitmapDarkenExtension - performs image processing to darken the pixels of the WriteableBitmap.

-    StorageFileExtensions.GetSize()/.GetSizeString() - allow to get the size of a file and its string representation (automatically converting from bytes to kB, MB, GB, TB)
-    StorageFolderExtensions
        .ContainsFile() - returns a value that states whether a file with specific name exists in the folder
        .CreateTempFile() - creates a temporary file
        .CreateTempFileName() - returns an unused, unique file name for a temporary file
-    StringIOExtensions - allows to easily read or write a string from/to file in a single call
-    Serialization
-        JsonSerialization - allows to serialize a properly DataContract-annotated object to a JSON string or file or deserialize an existing one.
-        XmlSerialization - allows to serialize a properly DataContract- or XmlSerializer-annotated object to a XML string or file or deserialize an existing one.

Using a browser control impacts performance and limits the UI experience (e.g. the WebView control does not support transparency). RichTextBlock.Html2Xaml adds an Html extension property to RichTextBlock controls, that you can set (or data bind) to a string containing an Html snippet.

[ValidatableBase](https://github.com/scionwest/ValidatableBase) Model Validation for Universal WinRT Apps through delegate method invocation per-property or DataAnnotation styled attribute validation. Added validation interception support. You may now have the built-in validation rules invoke a delegate method. This provides you with a little more flexibility when performing validation. You may piggy back on top of existing rules for minor checks instead of resorting to a full delegate validation method. By letting your model inherit from ValidatableBase, you can force validation checks on a model from within your view model. Binding to the view is really easy, using one of the two provided converters. The library comes with support for validating minimum and maximum numeric values, ranges of numeric values, string length, null objects, empty collections, empty or null strings and custom delegate method invocation. If you want to write your own attribute validation, you just need to implement IValidationRule and then decorate your object.

SSDP allows you to discover devices and services on a (local) network. RSSDP is designed primarily to publish and discover custom or 'basic' devices, and as such does not implement the full UPnP device architecture. If you are looking to build a device for which a full UPnP device schema exists, this is not the library for you (sorry! though I guess you can fork and extend if you like). If you are looking for a way to discover a custom service (such as a proprietary REST or SOAP service) from a device, RSSDP might be the solution for you.

[PoolSharp](https://github.com/Yortw/PoolSharp) PoolSharp is a simple, light weight, thread safe object pool. It also supports pooling of disposable types, managing the life time of pooled objects and performing early dispose when possible.

![](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=playerframework&DownloadId=527525)

Video players can be incredibly difficult to build. When developers require support for adaptive streaming, closed captioning, advertising standards integration, DVR-style playback control, and other advanced features, the complexity of their video player grows exponentially. Over the last few years at Microsoft we have helped build some of the most advanced video applications on the Web including the browser-based experience for the Beijing and Vancouver Olympics with NBC Sports, the last three seasons of NBC's Sunday Night Football (including the 2012 Super Bowl), the CBS March Madness college basketball tournament, Wimbledon, and a number of other major, live events with millions of simultaneous users. As a part of those projects we have developed one of the most powerful video players on the planet. And we've decided to share it with everyone, for free.  The Microsoft Media Platform's Player Framework is an open source video player that we continue to develop and evolve. It is available for Silverlight, HTML5, Windows Phone, Xbox, and now, in our latest release, Windows 10 UWP applications. And it's fully open source!

The WriteableBitmap class is available for all XAML flavors including Windows Phone, WPF, WinRT Windows Store XAML, (Windows 10) UWP and Silverlight. It was even ported to Windows Embedded. WriteableBitmapEx allows the direct manipulation of a bitmap and can be used for image manipulation, to generate fast procedural images by drawing directly to a bitmap and more. The WriteableBitmap API is very minimalistic and there's only the raw Pixels array for such operations. The WriteableBitmapEx library tries to compensate that with extensions methods that are easy to use like built in methods and offer GDI+ like functionality. The library extends the WriteableBitmap class with elementary and fast (2D drawing) functionality, conversion methods and functions to combine (blit) WriteableBitmaps. The extension methods are grouped into different C# files using a partial class approach. It is possible to include just a few methods by using the specific source code files directly or the full functionality via the built binaries.

# Testing

Opinionated Note: There is a lot of scaffolding issues to consider for testing UWP apps and I have a healthy sckepticism of social memes such as "Agile" and "Unit Testing" so this category is essential at the bottom of my attention list so, please let me know if I have missed any libraries and tools associated with UWP Testing

# Samples That Don't Hurt Your Eyeballs

There are lots of UWP App samples but most of them look like crap either because they are meant to demo a Windows 10 UWP feature or else total lack of aesetic sense. This section will give you some hope that one day the Windows Store won't be full of junk.

### Any UWP App on GitHub
